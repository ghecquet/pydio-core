<p>This plugin will delegate various time/memory-consuming actions to the underlying filesystem. <br><br>

Delegation can be made via ZIP / WinRAR / 7ZIP or custom took using the %archive%, %files%, %listfile%, %outputfile% placeholders.

Path to the ZIP tool can either be in the system Path or set via the Administration Screens.

Tested on both Linux and windows. If active, the "compress" action, as well as the "download folder" action, will trigger a background action monitoring the current percent of the ZIP operation. This allows the compression of huge amount of data.
